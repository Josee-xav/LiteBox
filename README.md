# LiteBox

SHIFT + RIGHT CLICK  = open litebox menu

Middle click = Closes application windows when over the app button on taskbar

Left , Right click = open and close window

You can right click tray icons just like normal but some tray applications might be funky...

=====


Fully functioning shell that goes ON TOP of the explorer shell as the explorer shell poses alot of functionality on windows 10. for example no explorer shell means no settings app and so on... which SUCKS :( as u cant FULLY replace the shell.

There is bugs. normally they can get  resolved by doing SHIFT +  right, click the taskbar then restart litebox which wil clear restart the taskbar window and all the elements. 

Can be styled as you wish. Examples:
