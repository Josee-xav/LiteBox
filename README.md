# LiteBox
Alternative Shell. Inspired by https://blackbox4windows.com/. amazing community and shell.

Fully functioning shell that goes ON TOP of the explorer shell as the explorer shell poses alot of functionality on windows 10. for example no explorer shell means no settings app and so on... which SUCKS :( as u cant FULLY replace the shell.

There is bugs. If anyone wants to help then just submit an issue report and such then ill review the pull request. Standard github contributor procedure basically.
But if u ever experience a bug, normally they can get temporarly resolved by doing SHIFT +  right click the taskbar then restart litebox. 

Can be styled as you wish. Examples:
